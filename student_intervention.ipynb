Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

      "*Model workings: The model (Logistic Regression) aims to find a mapping transformation or function between input features and the output column (passed here). The parameters of this function are calculated in a way so that the accuracy of the model (in predicting the right value of output column) on unseen data is maximized.*\n",

      "\n",
      "*Logistic Regression works in a similar way as Linear Regression. Let me explain Linear Regression first. In Linear Regression, we are given input and outut variables that are continuous. For example, X=height, Y=weight. Now, we try to fit a straight line to the input and output data(Height and weight). There could be multiple lines that may fit that data. But we aim to get the line that best fits the data using our criteria. In all practical applications, not all points will lie on that straight line. We then calculate the errors by which a particular line misses the target variable. We get to the best fit line by minimizing this error. We actually calculate the average of sum of squared errors and minimize this quantity. We train our data to fit a straight line. Inorder to predict, we use a new value of X and use the line to predict the Y value for the given X value. However, in the case of current problem we do not have a target column that is continuous. Our target column \"passed\" only takes 2 values (\"yes\" or \"no\"). We could use linear regression here but the line would not be an appropriate fit here. The slope of line would change with addition of new data making it un-robust. If we were to have a continuous variable to be our target column, we could use the framework for linear regression. In order to have a continuous output, we first linearly transform our input data (just like in linear regression) and then apply a sigmoid function on top of that. A sigmoid function always outputs a number that is between 0 and 1. SInce the output is always between 0 and 1, it can be thought as probability. When we train this model, we assume that positive examples belong to class \"yes\" and the transformed input be greater than 0 because sigmoid of a number greater than 0 is greater than 0.5. In probability terms, the chance of input being in the positive class (label:\"yes\") is greater than 0.5, hence it has to be in the positive class (label: yes).*\n",
      "\n",
      "*Prediction: Once we have trained the model with train data, we then have a transformation or mapping similar to what we have in the case of linear regression. We use this line equation or parameter set to calculate the transformed input variable. Applyting sigmoid fucntion on top of the transofrmed variable yields an output which is between 0 and 1 (which is the probability that the input belongs to positive class (label: yes). If the pronbaility is greater than 0.5, we classify orpredict the inpput to be in the positive class (;abel: yes), otherwise, we predict it to be in the negative class (label: no).*\n",
